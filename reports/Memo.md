## Memo


The two main issues that we are trying to solve are: to be able to accurately diagnose Pneumonia from an X-ray and to help relieve the strain from rural health clinics that lack proper resources and trained staff. While the computer model we use is quite good, we realized that we now have one additional question to resolve. Given that the computer model isn’t always correct with it’s predictions, how do we gauge and measure accuracy?

Our main goal for this project is to reach a high accuracy with the chosen model. High accuracy is important when classifying whether an X-ray shows a patient with or without Pneumonia. This is especially true if the model says the X-ray is negative for Pneumonia when it is actually active. In other words, when the image shows Pneumonia, how accurate is our model’s prediction. We achieved a strong recall score of 0.99. 

Additionally, if our model predicts Pneumonia it is correct 86%. It is recommended to have further research on how to reduce the false positive rate. While it is currently not very poor, it has a good amount of room for improvement. This algorithm can be adapted for use in other medical image recognition tasks. Overall, executives should care as this could have potential savings in operation costs as well as reducing wait times for diagnoses along with increased efficiency for staff.

If our team had additional time to complete this project, I believe we would have chosen to do more initial reading and research. For instance it would have been good to take a day to read up on this problem and how others have tried to solve it so far. Additional time would have been beneficial so that our group could dig deeper into the workings of neural networks. It is our belief that this would have saved us a lot of time that we spent running different iterations of models. Overall, despite the limited timeframe we are quite satisfied with our final result.
